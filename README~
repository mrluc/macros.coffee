 macros.coffee

 A real readme is coming.

 For now:

   - There's an html REPL that loads the .coffee with xhr, and a dumb webrick file to serve it with.
     I use it to fiddle around in and make sure that the node stuff I added doesn't break browser
     compatability.

   - At the end of macros.coffee there's a few lines to let it be used from node. If you call it
     with a list of coffee files it'll compile them with macro support.

   - The code is full of line noise ATM. ;)
