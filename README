 macros.coffee

 This is currently just a proof-of-concept/prototype of macros in CoffeeScript.

 A real readme is coming.

 For now:

   - macros.coffee
     contains the implementation

   - lib/core_macros.coffee
     contains the quote macro, which you'll want (probably) and the Current Callback 
     macro, which is all line noise and is proof-of-concept for sync-> async.

   - There's an html REPL that loads the .coffee with xhr, and a dumb webrick file to serve it with.
     I use it to fiddle around in and make sure that the node stuff I added doesn't break browser
     compatability.

   - At the end of macros.coffee there's a few lines to let it be used from node. If you call it
     with a list of coffee files it'll compile them with macro support.

   - The code is full of line noise ATM. ;)
